You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses ""...it's mostly water,"" our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.

However, what I DID like about these bars was the ""Protein Fit"" label; if I am going to grab a bar for breakfast, I want it to be high in protein rather than some sugary cereal bar.  These South Beach Protein Fit Bars have 9 grams protein (I usually look for 8 or more), 8 grams sugar (about 1 1/2 teaspoons--very reasonable), and 3.5 grams fat, with 2 of those being saturated (I don't worry overly about fat myself, but others might find the saturated fat content a bit on the high side).  The bars also contain a good dose of additional nutrition, with 3grams of fiber, 15% of the daily calcium requirement, and various other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of these bars as well.  Unlike many other chocolate products of this type, the chocolate tastes natural rather than artificial.  In additional, the bars have a very nice texture:  they are like a flaky, moist cereal bar.  Personally, I could have done without the extra drizzle of chocolate on top, but I think that chocolate lovers will truly love these bars.  I would definitely recommend the Chocolate Protein Fit bar to others; I plan to check out the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Y10YY2"">South Beach Protein Fit Cinnamon Raisin</a> flavor for myself."

With the other two grinders we had to reverse the grinder several times because meat got hung up.  Also, we would have to let it ""cool down"".  With this one we have NEVER had to reverse it, and the motor stays cool.  We do shut it down several times so we can crack the chicken leg bones with a mallet (we were told to do that by the manufacturer) and we do a bunch of legs at a time.

Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites."

I thought this was just a common attribute among microwavable popcorn products until several years ago when I tried making it the old fashioned way with the same results.<br /><br />What I have come to realize is, it's not how you prepare the popcorn, it's whether or not it's ""organic.""

The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.  I've tried various supplements and foods over the years and although she may sway a bit when walking and tire easily she's now 8 years old and we frequently go on short hikes together.<br /><br />I started feeding her Happy Hips about 4 months ago.  Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites."

If you can get it cut and on the cake without tearing, it looks great, but it's very delicate work.  Buy 2 the first time you use it, because you will probably need a backup.  I cut out a VERY simple silhouette of a black cat to go on top of an orange Halloween cake and even that simple shape had to be trimmed and finessed because the edges would tear as I was cutting (I used small sharp cuticle scissors).  If you have a Cricut and lots of shapes to cut with, it's probably a lot easier, but I don't anticipate using these enough to justify the expense.  Cool concept- but I think it would work much better if the sheets were a little thicker and sturdier.<br /><br />ALSO- the black will stain your fingers and your tongue (!) when you eat it.  Kids thought it was great, hubby and me not so much.<br /><br />By the way, I DON'T recommend the pre-cut letter sheets.  The letters are small and not very well cut.  I couldn't get them off the backing without tearing them- I ended up having to pipe the letters on anyway, which I could have done in the first place much more quickly and easily.  Not worth the $4-$5."

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

I also do suggest this flavor, most or all of the Izze line uses some of the flavor of juice listed on the can, but also some grape and/or apple juice as a ""filler"".  They do the same here, but it tastes first like clementine or at least orange juice, and then a hint of the others come through.

I don't think she even chews the things, she inhales them so fast. Tuna treats are ok but chicken were more popular around here. She likes these better than the Temptations treats she had before, and I am convinced that these are somewhat healthier.<br /><br />The pouch recommends 12 treats a day, all at once, or even more for my big-boned cat. I usually do more like 5-6, because that many treats seems excessive (she would love it though). Either way, she hasn't had any hairballs since. I am not positive about the causal relationship, but I suspect these did the trick. They're great!"

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

The first one I tried was vitaminwater Attention which has caffeine in it. I initially like the results, but the next week I had taken a nap prior to drinking it and the caffeine became too overwhelming when I played my games and it caused me to rush a bit during my shots. It was my worst performance all summer long. For the last few months I've been drinking a neuro SONIC prior to my games and I LOVE IT! It gives me the focus I need without revving my engine up too much like the vitaminwater Attention did. I see a lot of people complaining about the price, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. Comparing it to the vitaminwater Attention it has A LOT more brain power ingredients, so it's not like they're overcharging you for nothing. They have a far superior product to any Monster or Red Bull or any other caffeine-loaded energy drinks on the market. And it gives you a lot more focus than 5 Hour Energy does as well. So the $2.50-$3.00 price tag is well worth it to me.<br /><br />I also like to mix this with a little sativa and the results are remarkable. I've been doing this combo all season long (started in September ends in December) and I'm the highest ranked player on my team. The best player on our team started the season off slow but he's been picking it up a bit lately so he might catch me by the end of the season. But if I keep up my winnings with the neuro SONIC & sativa combo I think I can keep my spot."

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

So if you like sweet sauces, you're also covered here.<br /><br />I put the Spicy Original on my mashed potatoes and Original No. 7 Recipe on ham, so you're not limited to pulled pork or ribs.  But I used to live in Memphis, where I would eat barbeque pizza and barbeque spaghetti.<br /><br />Overall, I don't consider this expensive for what you get, and I'm pleased with the quality of the product.  Now if I could get the jelly at a reasonable price without having to go to Lynchburg, I'd be good to go."

It's got pureed organic baby food in a little pouch.  Easier to transport than the little glass jars.  If your baby eats a lot, there's a lot more food per pouch.  The nozzle and cap makes it easy to squeeze straight onto a spoon and feed baby with no mess (at least on this end).  Also, since the food theoretically is being transferred from the pouch to the spoon, you don't have cross-contamination of the baby's mouth germs being reintroduced back into the jar of baby food.<br />The color of this particular product leaves a bit to be desired.  But the flavor was fine (to me) and the pear and garden greens combo is pretty nice and healthy.<br /><br />I echo the same concerns that another reviewer posted.  I actually got this product a little earlier since I knew my baby would be eating in a month or so.  Lo and behold, once I opened it when he was ready for solids, the expiration had already passed.  Perhaps this is only an issue for the free stuff we're getting through Vine reviews; I sure hope so.  But somebody ought to think twice about giving out stuff on the cusp of expiration that is meant for babies and their uniquely sensitive systems.  This is also relevant given that the baby food comes packaged as a pack of 12.  Now, I don't know who would buy a package of 12 food pouches of the *exact* same flavor.  Your baby must really love pear and greens.  Moreover, I mentioned that each pouch is 4.5 ounces.  That's more than 2 glass jars' worth.  My personal thought is that unless your child has texture issues or low oral muscle tone, the baby is probably going to move through the pureed food stage a lot faster than you could possibly go through 12 pouches of this baby food (I'm assuming that you're also providing him/her with other flavors, though).<br /><br />I also recommend looking into the Happy Baby brand of baby food.  It also comes in neat little pouches and has organic pureed fruits and veggie combos; but it adds additional Salba grains that are naturally rich in Omega-3s."

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.

Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.

She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites."

I now have to order it online at unheard of prices because the grocery store no longer carries it, but I do so because it really is the best. It's the perfect blend of salt, spiciness, and FLAVOR. I've tried other cajun and creole seasonings that were saltier or hotter (or both--I'm talking to you, Tony Chachere's More Spice!), but none were tastier. Makes the best blackened chicken."

It still has a little bit of caffeine, but much less than coffee does.  It's nice and spicy (you really get the flavor of black pepper) and actually easy to prepare.  Initially, I thought it was too complicated to boil water and then add milk separately, but it allows you to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.  If you want sweet, you add your own sweetener - I usually use a spoonful of white sugar or honey.  After drinking this stuff, I tried some pre-sweetended mix, and there was no comparison.  This stuff tastes ""real"" and without chemicals or preservatives."

Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits."

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

Someone said to mop the floor with vinegar. Skeptical, but desperate, I did ONE mopping of the vinegar all over the kitchen floor. Just like that, as soon as it dried my floor was clean again. Extremely excited, I looked up more magic ways vinegar cleans. Then I ran out of vinegar, and had to buy some more.

As wine & beer making have several steps over time I will update this review as I proceed through all the steps. This is a very heavy container.  Getting that bag empty will be the trickiest part of the wine kit I think. I was simply not strong enough to pick up the bag of 'must' from the bucket shipping container. What I did was to dump the contents of the shipping bucket into my plastic food grade fermentation vessel.<br /><br />Because I couldn't lift the bag out of the primary I had to cut a hole in the bag as near to the bottom as possible and lift the bag out of the primary as the bag drained.  This was still a tricky procedure as the 'must' initially just pooled on top of the 23 liter bag of must.  I think next time I try one of these 55 lbs kits I am going to borrow my step-son who works unloading UPS trucks everyday and is strong as a horse to hold the bag of must clear of the 'primary' while I open the bag the proper way and let it drain into the primary.<br /><br />I have at the time of this writing transferred the juice/must to my plastic primary fermentation vessel, added the bentonite, stirred, added the yeast, and stirred again.  I don't take the specific gravity as I like my wines very dry and so I just let them ferment out completely.  I do like that the kit includes corks (one less thing to purchase)."

There is a slight aftertaste, but it isn't unpleasant.  I made it hot, but didn't finish it and the air conditioning was on, so it got cold.

Bland?!,"To everyone giving less stars on here for it being 'bland,' my brain is attempting not to spontaneously combust. It. Is. Oatmeal. It's not like you just went and bought a box of Lucky Charms. Do you know what else is bland? Cheerios! Doesn't make them any less amazing.<br /><br />This cereal is always exactly what I've been looking for in a cereal, something I've found almost every, single other brand, be it big label or generic lacks. It's actually filling. Sure, if you eat enough of any cereal, you'll feel full after a while, but this is the only one I've found where even a moderate bowlful leaves me feeling quite satisfied, almost like an actual bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />Another good aspect is that it isn't overly sweet. And of course, it's whole grain and full of fiber, so, whee...it's even somewhat good for you.<br /><br />After having eaten cereal almost my entire childhood, I had lost the taste for it when I got older, and have, over the course of the past 15 years, not really had any interest in cereal products. However, since my 8 year old girl is a bit of a cereal aficionado and there is always random boxes of cereal in the house, I end up eating a bowl now and again. Until I discovered these. Suddenly, for the first time in a decade and a half, I'm back to a bowl of cold cereal every day for breakfast.<br /><br />Kudos to Quaker, you've made a breakfast cereal that I truly do enjoy."

Whatever they do to powder it, along with the other sweeteners listed on the label, gives it kind of a weird aftertaste. Ginger itself is kind of sweet, and the bit of lemon is a good complement, but the aftertaste here is just weird.<br /><br />I actually think I'll go back to dumping plain old real ginger into a cup of tea, despite the need to strain the cup or ignore the dregs, for the taste I love.

One thing though, it is better to refrigerate the buns and microwave a few seconds to warm it and not do the usual bbq or toast warming. I have found that microwaving makes reguar bread rubbery but not so the low carb buns (same for their hot dog buns) while the usual warming makes them dry. The ingredients are different and so the warming needed is different. Done this way they do not come out dry and cardboardy. and using more condiments helps also.

This really could be any bean, as far as flavor goes once the coal black roast is finished. Buy a French roast or a Sumatra and save yourself a couple bucks."

After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU"">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4"">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's ""Big Easy Bold"").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one.

I searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily.

You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies."

First of all, unlike many others, they are not just plain hot, they are actually really, really tasty.<br /><br />I'm an average heat lover. That means I don't count drops when adding Tabasco to my meal, but not eating whole habaneros instead of cucumbers either :)<br />So here's my humble opinion about this combo:<br /><br />1) Jalapeno Death. Jalapenos, tomatillos and tequila. Very mild, crispy and refreshing. Amazing on tamales. Expect to finish this bottle fast.<br /><br />2) Original Death - delicious, frutty and moderately spicy. If you felt like original Tabasco is not hot enough, this one will be just right. Good with pretty much everything. I did not try it on oysters yet, but expecting this to be superb combination.<br /><br />3) After Death. That's where the fun begins! Nice punch of habanero and long peppery aftertaste. Great on red meat, absolutely gorgeous on lamb and pork.  My favorite so far.<br /><br />4) Sudden Death. Did you read the recommendation on the bottle about using a micro-drop? Oh, you didn't... Well, you probably should. This thing is HOT. But it feels interesting: not an instant kick, but rather fast growing powerful avalanche of heat with long earthy aftertaste. It will put tears on your eyes and smile on your face - that's for sure. And because there's no instant kick, it is really easy to overdose, so be careful.<br />This sauce also has Siberian ginseng in it (not sure if it affects taste, but just having it in sauce is cool indeed)<br /><br />P.S. I'm looking forward to trying out Mega and Ultra Death<br /><br />P.P.S.  With this combo you also get two very nice and surprisingly well made skull keychains."

Cats cant process grains but you have to have something to hold the kibble together. They use alfalfa and brown rice which is better than corn.<br /><br />2) No meat by-products or even 'meal'.  Meal/byproducts could be anything pretty much.  It could be perfectly fine organ meat that humans don't eat a lot of, so theres a good supply.  It could be feathers, gristle, whatever.  It's generally best to avoid when possible.<br /><br />3) The first seven ingredients are meat-based.  This means a very limited amount of filler as an 8th ingredient could only theoretically be less than 12.5% of the whole product by weight.<br /><br />4) The variety of meats is also beneficial, especially inclusion of liver which is nutritious.<br /><br />It is a good idea to feed your cat at least some canned wet food to ensure kitty gets enough water.

I've also recently started trying to only wash every other day when possible (using Suave dry shampoo on the days off), and this works fine with that routine - I don't feel greasy on day 2. I've found this to be more pleasantly thick than some 2-in-1 dandruff shampoos, which are very thin and kind of get all over the place as you squeeze them out of the bottle.<br /><br />I also tried another variety of this brand - just because I was curious of the difference between that and this. I thought one might have a ""manly"" fragrance, but neither I nor my husband can tell a difference in smell or anything else.

I just could not meet the quota that baby wanted to consume through pumping, no matter how often I pumped, what supplements I took, what diet I had, etc. I started using the Enfamil samples they sent me in the mail before I had my baby. First of all, I was kinda disgusted with how yucky it smelled. Baby didn't seem to like it either and spit up most of it after drinking it. We went to try their formula for babies who are gassy and as I was waiting for it to warm up I read the ingredient label and was shocked to see that the very first ingredient was corn syrup solids. Really??? In infant formula? I know it needs to contain sugar but come on!<br />So that started me on a research binge and I found that all formulas have to have some sort of sugar in them, but the kind of sugar is what matters. Moms make lactose and glucose (although in smaller amounts than lactose) and there is also fructose and sucrose. Fructose is what they make from corn (AKA HFCS), and sucrose is what they use in artificial sweeteners. I voted primarily for lactose and glucose, but found that a lot of formulas focused on fructose and sucrose, and if they had glucose it was from brown rice (this was during the scare that rice had arsenic in it).<br />FINALLY I found Earth's Best. I was impressed that not only did it have lactose and glucose but glucose was the 4TH ingredient instead of the first or second. This was the most important point to me in purchasing, but even more important -was baby going to like it? When I mixed it the first time it didn't have a sour odor to it, and it smelled like milk (granted, as all formula, it smells after it sits for a while). It even looked like milk (hooray) AND baby gobbled it right up. ALL OF IT. She loves the stuff! Best part is there are no problems with transitioning from breast to bottle, so now she is supplemented with the formula after her fill of breast-milk when I'm home. She even gets excited to drink it!<br />I think there's something everyone needs to keep in mind. We don't live in a `clean' society any more. Everything has toxins and chemicals, you have to choose the lesser of two evils. Everything is bad in excess: sunshine can give you cancer, tap water can give you cavities and diseases and raw fruits and veggies can give you pesticides. Even air is bad for you, depending on where you live. So I say, do the best with what you have and don't let yourself get too carried away with all the hype about harmful stuff. In the end, I feel I made the right choice for my baby and chose the next best thing to breast-milk that I could find that was relatively affordable and easy to obtain."

I started my labracollie on Instinct Grain-Free Duck/Turkey about two months ago, when I ran out of her usual dog food (which was working out ""okay"") and had to give her our wiener dog's food.  I immediately noticed how pungent this dog food was.  It smelled very concentrated but I ensured myself it was not bad by checking the kibble and expiration date.  The smell may shock some people, but after that initial surprise, I noticed how eager my dog looked when she got a whiff of this food.  I think some dogs like stinky-smelling food.  She started eating it right away, and the very next day I was happy to see that she passed a normal stool!  It was even great that she was not scratching like she a maddog.<br /><br />After she did well on the Duck/Turkey, I bought the Beef/Lamb.  She was fine on this one too.  I try to give her a variety of options to keep her interested in her meals so I was glad that I found at least two choices<br /><br />It's only been two months so I can't comment on how she does long-term.  I will probably update this review if I find notice anything that I feel could be shared.  My dog is about 52 pounds and I go through the 13-pound bag in about two weeks.  The results, so far, definitely validate the additional cost; and I feel this brand is decently priced compared to other grain-free dog foods out there.  So far she has tried the Turkey/Duck and Beef/Lamb and she liked both of them, and is still passing normal stool.  Unfortunately she's allergic to chicken so I can't give her the Chicken mix and she has never particularly cared for fish so I am debating if I should bother with the Salmon Meal.  My next bag will probably be the Instinct Grain-Free Limited Ingredients, just to give it a try.<br /><br />So to recap...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.

Wellness brand did the job.  My dog seems to love the food and the skin issues cleared up within a few weeks.

I walk by those brightly colored containers in the grocery store, take them down from the shelf salivating and lamenting the fact that about 2 tablespoons of the sticky goodstuff is about a meal's worth of Weight Watcher's points.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />So I jump at the chance to consume any diet-centered peanut butter product. These South Beach treats are very good: covered in peanut butter, with the deep rich nutty taste that one would expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by how thick was the flavor, and I realized 20-30 minutes after I was done, I felt quite full. These are a must-buy for any peanut butter-lovin' dieter.<br /><br />The only downside is for those dieters on Weight Watchers, and I understand that this is made for the South Beach dieters: this treat comes in at about 4 WW points which is a little higher than my typical target for any non-meal snack."

This includes whiskey, beer and now oatmeal!  The oatmeal, of course, is the healthiest of the three!  I know that Oprah has recommended steel cut oats for their health benefits, and while I'm not big into listening to Oprah it appears she's right on target here.  I started eating these right after a cholesterol test, the doctor wanted to put me on medication and I asked if I could come back and take another test in two weeks.  I changed my diet to include Irish oats for breakfast every morning and in two weeks the doctor said ""hey, whatever you're doing just keep it up"" as the numbers were much better.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there's nothing that is a miracle here, but they are definitely a healthy choice for breakfast that will leave you better off than sugar filled cereals or bacon and eggs.  The oatmeal's taste is fairly bland, as you'd expect from oatmeal so I like to make mine with cinnamon and raisins or with either a little honey or sweetner added.<br /><br />Amazon has always been a better price than any of our normal grocery stores so it's a great place to get them if you're local club store doesn't carry it!"

I have been looking for something I can add to my dog's food to give her a bit of variation, that won't make her tummy sick.  This was the perfect solution.  You can actually see what is inside and the ingredients are mostly very natural.<br /><br />At first I rehydrated the food with some water and added kibble on top.  This worked out great and it was so much easier than taking wet food out of a can.  I suppose if you aren't too concerned with financial costs, and your dog is doing well on this food, keep going.  But 6 pounds of food for $20.00 is not going to work for me.<br /><br />I realize that the directions say you should add water but the owner of the local pet store that I purchased this from suggested to sprinkle a small amount on top of kibble, just dry.  I did this and my dog liked it.  At one point she would just lick up the dehydrated bits; and slowly eat the kibble.  I mix the dehydrated parts with the kibble now.  This made the dehydrated food last much longer than.  A box lasts a few months now, and my dog enjoys eating her meals.<br /><br />So far I have tried the Herbed Lamb and Beef Zucchini.

She is a much happier little feline!<br /><br />So, I am now a happy customer. I would recommend this cat to anyone, it is so much healthier than most other cat foods out there. My cat loves the taste, and her behavior shows me she is feeling great too!"

I started my labracollie on Instinct Grain-Free Duck/Turkey about two months ago, when I ran out of her usual dog food (which was working out ""okay"") and had to give her our wiener dog's food.  I immediately noticed how pungent this dog food was.  It smelled very concentrated but I ensured myself it was not bad by checking the kibble and expiration date.  The smell may shock some people, but after that initial surprise, I noticed how eager my dog looked when she got a whiff of this food.  I think some dogs like stinky-smelling food.  She started eating it right away, and the very next day I was happy to see that she passed a normal stool!  It was even great that she was not scratching like she a maddog.<br /><br />After she did well on the Duck/Turkey, I bought the Beef/Lamb.  She was fine on this one too.  I try to give her a variety of options to keep her interested in her meals so I was glad that I found at least two choices<br /><br />It's only been two months so I can't comment on how she does long-term.  I will probably update this review if I find notice anything that I feel could be shared.  My dog is about 52 pounds and I go through the 13-pound bag in about two weeks.  The results, so far, definitely validate the additional cost; and I feel this brand is decently priced compared to other grain-free dog foods out there.  So far she has tried the Turkey/Duck and Beef/Lamb and she liked both of them, and is still passing normal stool.  Unfortunately she's allergic to chicken so I can't give her the Chicken mix and she has never particularly cared for fish so I am debating if I should bother with the Salmon Meal.  My next bag will probably be the Instinct Grain-Free Limited Ingredients, just to give it a try.<br /><br />So to recap...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good for dogs with sensitive tummies and food allergies<br />2. Kibbles are small.<br />3. Reasonable price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Smells strong."

You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies."

He enjoyed the meal and stated that he'd love to have them on hand if the price point was more reasonable.  He ate his  Fusilla & Veg Marinara with a large salad seasoned only with some balsamic vingar and had it for his dinner meal.  To use the Chinese food cliche, he told me an hour later he was hungry again so I made him a grilled chicken breast.  That got me to thinking that the packaged meal alone wouldn't work for us as a stand-alone  meal.  We'd have to add to it for it to work.  If these were a dollar per package cheaper after Subscribe & Save, they might make a good shelf stable meal to which you could add cooked chicken strips, canned chicken, black beans or even a high quality pouched tuna.  On it's own, it's not filling enough nor nutritionally complete.<br /><br />Right at this moment, Amazon is showing me an offer for a $5 off Amazon coupon which when applied, brings the price point after Subscribe & Save down to $2.38, which is  quite a bit better and rather tempting.  However, after seeing this, I asked my husband if he wanted me to order some for the pantry and suddenly he wasn't as in love with the product any more.  Oh well!  When you add in the cost of a small salad plus some lean protein such as the gilled chicken breast, even with the $5 off, it brings the per meal cost back up to around $4.60.  That may sound like a bargain if you eat out often or grab fast food a few nights a week but we don't.  I plan our meals out for the week and even sometimes for an entire month ahead of time to get the most from every grocery item we buy and I could make this same dish using Barilla High protein pasta, my own vegetable marinara with veg from my gardens and come out quite a bit cheaper.  I also think I could eliminate some of the high sodium contant and bring down the fat in the dish as well.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, however, because hubby liked it, it was simple to prepare and even a starving teenager can toss in some chicken strips of canned chicken to make it a more filling meal.  There's enough sauce in the meal to coat a moderate amount of added chicken or meat.  I could see this being a good pantry staple for a college student or a busy single person. As shelf-stable meals go, even though I wasn't all that impressed with the sodium count and fat, this brand compares quite favorable with other shelf-stable meals. It could be a good choice for folks in ned of something o brag and nuke quickly at the end of a long day and in place of ordering in restaurant food.  For a family on a budget.. not so much of a deal."

I just could not meet the quota that baby wanted to consume through pumping, no matter how often I pumped, what supplements I took, what diet I had, etc. I started using the Enfamil samples they sent me in the mail before I had my baby. First of all, I was kinda disgusted with how yucky it smelled. Baby didn't seem to like it either and spit up most of it after drinking it. We went to try their formula for babies who are gassy and as I was waiting for it to warm up I read the ingredient label and was shocked to see that the very first ingredient was corn syrup solids. Really??? In infant formula? I know it needs to contain sugar but come on!<br />So that started me on a research binge and I found that all formulas have to have some sort of sugar in them, but the kind of sugar is what matters. Moms make lactose and glucose (although in smaller amounts than lactose) and there is also fructose and sucrose. Fructose is what they make from corn (AKA HFCS), and sucrose is what they use in artificial sweeteners. I voted primarily for lactose and glucose, but found that a lot of formulas focused on fructose and sucrose, and if they had glucose it was from brown rice (this was during the scare that rice had arsenic in it).<br />FINALLY I found Earth's Best. I was impressed that not only did it have lactose and glucose but glucose was the 4TH ingredient instead of the first or second. This was the most important point to me in purchasing, but even more important -was baby going to like it? When I mixed it the first time it didn't have a sour odor to it, and it smelled like milk (granted, as all formula, it smells after it sits for a while). It even looked like milk (hooray) AND baby gobbled it right up. ALL OF IT. She loves the stuff! Best part is there are no problems with transitioning from breast to bottle, so now she is supplemented with the formula after her fill of breast-milk when I'm home. She even gets excited to drink it!<br />I think there's something everyone needs to keep in mind. We don't live in a `clean' society any more. Everything has toxins and chemicals, you have to choose the lesser of two evils. Everything is bad in excess: sunshine can give you cancer, tap water can give you cavities and diseases and raw fruits and veggies can give you pesticides. Even air is bad for you, depending on where you live. So I say, do the best with what you have and don't let yourself get too carried away with all the hype about harmful stuff. In the end, I feel I made the right choice for my baby and chose the next best thing to breast-milk that I could find that was relatively affordable and easy to obtain."

There were so many comments complaining about the packaging, stating that the litter was spilling out of the box when it arrived.  I was under the assumption that the Arm & Hammer box was shipped alone.  And that may be the case if shipped from another supplier, but I have a monthly subscription from Amazon. The 40lb litter box is placed in a different Amazon box before it ships.  Some of my litter spilled out too, but I just simply poured the 2 tablespoons back into the original box.  The subscription saves money and makes things so convenient, since it's delivered right to the door each month.  Then the shipping is free on top of all that.  Lifting 40lbs is no prob for me, but my girlfriend sure does appreciate the free delivery.<br />  Pertaining to the effectiveness of the litter......  I am a dog person, so being around cats is new to me.  I made my girlfriend try at least 10-12 different types of litter, and found that none of them work perfectly.  Arm & Hammer works for us since it meets most requirements better than others.  (masks odor better than any other I've tried, clumps well, inexpensive)  Then the subscription makes it so convenient.  This is a real unsolicited review....the type that I look for when I scan other reviews to help me make a decision.  I hope this helps someone."
34339,34340,B001P3NU30,A3G5DSR3NVJJFY,"Z. Abedin ""Z Unit""",0,0,4,1970-01-01 00:00:01.351123200,double duty!,"I have a 4yr old 30lb male beagle mix who absolutely LOVES these chews. I had originally bought them for the sole purpose of promoting good dental health, thinking my dog might chew on them if he got bored or if it was the only chew I gave him. You see, he's usually very picky- he won't chew antlers or bones, unflavored rawhide, nylabones, and though he'll lick peanut butter out of a kong, he doesn't do much if I put a treat in there.  To my surprise, as soon as my dog smells these chews, he can hardly control himself, he get so excited! They smell a little funky (meaty), but I think that's all part of what makes my dog love these chews.<br /><br />This is great for us, since it means he gets an after-dinner treat he loves, they have helped keep his teeth relatively plaque free, and they help keep his breath from smelling bad. Of course, his mouth doesn't exactly smell like your favorite flower (unless your favorite flower smells like dog breath), but I have noticed that the distance at which I start to smell my dog's stinky dog-breath has shortened significantly, and his breath no longer causes people distress from a distance. Also nice is that these chews last a little while. For my dog, they will keep him occupied for around 15 minutes. This is great compared to the Kong brand fresh breath treats, which my dog chewed through right away, and they did very little for his teeth.<br /><br />To address other reviewers' comments, I should caution that my dog is somewhat small at 30lbs, and he is an incredibly patient chewer (though he will chew for very long periods of time). He will calmly chew his rawhides, etc, until he gets nice small pieces to swallow, and he avoids pieces that are too big to swallow, so these treats present little choking hazard for him. I understand the issue though, and I'd recommend that you treat these like any other thin rawhide squares, which is to say that they are a pretty big hazard for choking or for your dog swallowing large un-chewed pieces (which can cause an upset tummy). As with any rawhide-type treat, you should supervise your dog when you give these to them, especially the first few times. My biggest complaint of these chews is that I think they would last longer and be less of a choking hazard if they came as twists or rolls, instead of flat pieces, since the flat pieces are pretty easy to break.<br /><br />Since too much of a good thing is usually a bad thing, I also try to limit the number of these chews I give to my dog, since they appear to very similar to beef hide, and I don't want to give him too many hide chews. So, I give him one of these every other day, depending on the other treats he has had that day, and I alternate with greenies or other dental-type chews, so he has a variety of chews, but he gets some sort of dental health chew every day."

The bags are small, but a great size if you want to limit your snacking without having to engage your willpower.
